# BTMA
Welcome to the **Baseball Team Management Application**, or [BTMA](http://btma.herokuapp.com).  The BTMA is a **Rails** application in which you can manage your team’s roster, games, schedule, and team statistics.  This was a two week project (one week developing and one week refactoring) for [Omaha Code School](http://omahacodeschool.com/).  As of right now, the project is just a fraction of where I would like take it, which means it will be growing and being improved over the next several months.  In the mean time, create a team and try it out!

## Database
The application utilizes **Postgres**, several one to many associations, and a few complex table joins because of baseball’s heavy association with statistics.  The majority of the two weeks building the first version of this application was spent wrangling all of the database tables with **Active Record** and sometimes straight Postgres.

## Front-end
While I primarily focused on the "back-end" of this application, I was able to implement some basic **JavaScript** (mainly **jQuery**) and **AJAX**.  Also, the CSS was coded from scratch and the site is not yet responsive.  I have plans to do some major refactoring to clean up the CSS, improve the UX, and make it responsive.
